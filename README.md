# FallingWords - BabbelChallenge

## OPTION 1 - FALLING WORDS
### Idea
The task is to write a small language game. The player will see a word in language „one“ on the screen. While
this word is displayed, a word in language „two“ will fall down on the screen. The player will have to choose if
the falling word is the correct translation or a wrong translation. The player needs to answer, before the word
reaches the bottom of the screen. Include a counter that gives the player feedback.

### Room for creativity
It is up to the applicant to implement how the player chooses correct or wrong. Also when or if a game ends.
In what way correct/wrong/no answer is counted can also be freely chosen, but there must be some visual
feedback.

## EXPECTED RESULT
### Input
Along with this document the applicant will receive a file ‚words.json‘ to be used as the data for the game. The
file is also available on this URL. The file contains sets of translations between two languages. For the "wrong"
answers the applicant can randomly select any word from provided json.
Expected Output
The output should be a runnable Android Gradle project, preferably as a link to a GitHub repository, or sent as
a zip file.
### The candidate should consider:
* threading
* tests
* meaningful commit history (git)
### In addition a small project documentation should be included stating:
* how much time was invested (within the given limit)
* how was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
* decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
* decisions made because of restricted time
* what would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time
### Constraints
* The task should be completed in about 4 hours. It should not exceed 8 hours of work.
